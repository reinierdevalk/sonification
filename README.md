# sonification

To sonify a picture, do the following:

* Store the contents of this repository in a local folder. 
* `cd` into the folder and execute the following command:

    $ python sonify-new.py <pic_name>.*
    
  where `<pic_name>.*` is the picture file (any extension will do). 

* The script will store a MIDI file called `<pic_name>-sonified.mid`. Enjoy...!
