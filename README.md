# sonification

To sonify an image, do the following:

* Store the contents of this repository in a local folder. 

* `cd` into the folder and execute the following command:

    `$ python sonify.py img/<img_name>.*`
    
  where `<img_name>.*` is the image file (any extension will do) stored in the `img` folder. 

* The script stores a MIDI file called `<pic_name>-sonified.mid` in the `out` folder.
